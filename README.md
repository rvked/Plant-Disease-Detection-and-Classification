# Plant-Disease-Detection-and-Classification

A web application for detecting plant diseases using deep learning techniques. The application leverages React for the frontend and FastAPI for backend API testing. The image classification model, built with TensorFlow, is deployed on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and accessed via Google Cloud Functions (GCF). The system features a user-friendly interface for uploading images and displaying disease diagnoses.

## Features

- **Image Classification:** Detects various plant diseases from uploaded images using a TensorFlow CNN model.
- **Frontend:** Built with React, providing a user-friendly interface for image uploads and displaying results.
- **Backend:** FastAPI for testing and validating the backend API.
- **Deployment:** Model deployed on Google Cloud Platform and accessed through Google Cloud Functions.
- **Responsive Design:** Ensures usability across different devices.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend:** React
- **Backend:** FastAPI(Testing)
- **Model:** TensorFlow
- **Cloud Platform:** Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
- **Serverless Functions:** Google Cloud Functions (GCF)
